## 🚀 About Me

He/Him

  I studied Multimedia Engineering (2018/2023) in Universidad de Alicante, and specialized in **Videogames**, working with libraries like SFML for C++ developing, making our custom engine, or even programming in Assembly!
  While programming is one of my passions, music and sound is my others, and I try to combine them working with Middlewares like Wwise and Fmod (which I'm more comfortable with).

  In our 4th year in our degree, some classmates and I developed Into the Woods and Into the Crops. Two games made with Assembly and C++/OpenGL/FMod, programming our own ECS and custom Collisions. 

  Although I've worked with different languages, such as Java, JavaScript, C# and more, I try to focus on improving my C++ skills, as I found it one of the best (if not the best) languages for videogames.
  That's why for my final degrees assignment (TFG), I did my first Unreal Engine project, Into the Darkesss, a game that I used as both learning Unreal Engine and trying to make new games concept, such as being guided completly by the sound

  In 2024/2025 I decided to course Programa Avanzado en Programacion, at U-Tad, Madrid, and make Lady Umbrella. This development served as a real approach to the work environment of an indie studio, since there were around 40 of us working together to create this game.
  During this development, I specialized in working close to designers, to make mechanics come to live and try to perfect them to achive the best feel we could. I also worked in making tools for the team, in order to have a better work, such as GitBuild.bat, which nowadays I consider my son! :D
